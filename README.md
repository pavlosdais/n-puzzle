# n-puzzle

* **Gameplay**<br/>
The n-puzzle problem (most popularly known is the 8-puzzle or 15-puzzle) is a problem where we have at our disposal a nxn board with n*n-1 numbered tiles and an empty spot. A tile adjacent to the empty spot can be moved to this position. The acceptable moves are up, down, left, right. The goal is, starting from a given board to reach a given board where all the titles starting from the top left are sorted in ascending order. <br/>
For example, the puzzle <br/>
8 0 6<br/>
5 4 7<br/>
2 3 1<br/>
needs to reach the form:<br/>
1 2 3<br/>
4 5 6<br/>
7 8 0<br/>
